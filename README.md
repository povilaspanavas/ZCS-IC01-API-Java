# ZCS-IC01-API-Java
This is for devece ZCS IC01. In documentation folder you can also find code in VB 6.0.

I took the code from the documentation and tried to add what was missing. But still get status 12 while reading, which means password is incorrect).

Maybe someone would be able to benefit from it. At least, wouldn't need to copy code from pdf, add what's missing.

Also, you can find original documentation and installation files in directory Documentation

And don't forget to change this line: System.setProperty("jna.library.path", "C:\\Projects\\ZCS-IC01\\build\\classes\\zcs\\ic01"); It must point to the location of OUR_MIFARE.dll
